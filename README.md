# Phishing Detection API for Real-time Mobile Applications

This project presents an API designed to detect phishing attempts in real-time within mobile applications. Leveraging a combination of white and blacklisting techniques, the API offers a robust defense mechanism against fraudulent activities.

## Features:

1. **Real-time Detection**: The API enables instant identification of phishing attempts as users interact with the mobile application.

2. **White & Blacklist Approach**: Utilizing both white and blacklist methodologies enhances the accuracy of phishing detection. Approved URLs are whitelisted while suspicious or known phishing URLs are blacklisted, ensuring comprehensive protection.

3. **Scalability**: Engineered for scalability, the API efficiently handles varying levels of traffic and ensures consistent performance even during peak usage periods.

4. **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate the API into existing mobile applications with minimal effort, thanks to its intuitive design and comprehensive documentation.

5. **Customization**: Tailor the API to suit specific application requirements by adjusting sensitivity levels, updating blacklists, or integrating additional security layers.

## How It Works:

1. **URL Analysis**: Incoming URLs are analyzed in real-time against a curated database of known phishing websites.

2. **White & Blacklisting**: URLs are compared against whitelists of trusted sites and blacklists of known phishing domains. Suspicious URLs trigger alerts or preventive actions.

3. **Response Handling**: The API returns a response indicating the likelihood of phishing, allowing the application to take appropriate actions such as blocking access or issuing warnings to users.

## Usage:

1. **Integration**: Include the API within your mobile application's backend infrastructure using simple HTTP requests.

2. **Request Format**: Send URL requests to the API endpoint along with necessary authentication tokens and parameters.

3. **Response Handling**: Interpret the response provided by the API to determine the appropriate action within the mobile application interface.
